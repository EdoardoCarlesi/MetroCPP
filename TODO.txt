TO DO NEXT:

- Make the output .tmp files with all the halo lists selectable from the .cfg file

- speedup the comparison: for each compared halo (with 0 particles in common) see what the related / unrelated variables 
(distances, separations, angles): DEPRECATED, not needed 

- Need to fix the Buffer halos in the new scheme

- Keep track of the compared halos in the fwd loop and loop only on them in the backward

- Improve the load balancing scheme, after reading in the halos optimize the assignment to different tasks

- Linear-order n particle comparison: just store all the particle IDs into a map, <ull int, int> where the second int 
is the index to a vector storing all the halo IDs/indexes (there can be more halos for a single particle ID

- Cosmology class (to compute the expansion factor of the universe) 

- Gravity class (to compute the gravitational field at each point due to the neighbouring objects). 
Make it simple at first, use it only for objects with no progenitor to guess the position at the previous step and 
put a placeholder
