TO DO NEXT:

Small fixes: Move the ReadAHF from Halo to SettingsIO class
Introduce a compile time option NPTYPES = X to define the number of particles used GLOBALLY at compile time


Add: 
a Cosmology class (to compute the expansion factor of the universe) 
a Gravity class (to compute the gravitational field at each point due to the neighbouring objects). 
Make it simple at first, use it only for objects with no progenitor to guess the position at the previous step and 
put a placeholder
