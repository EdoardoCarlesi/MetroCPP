TO DO NEXT:

- Make the output .tmp files with all the halo lists selectable from the .cfg file

- In some cases if the descendant is on one task and the progenitor is on another task the match is not done properly

- If non zoom mode is on allow for one single non mpi file to be read (.0000. string)

- Cosmology class (to compute the expansion factor of the universe) 

- Gravity class (to compute the gravitational field at each point due to the neighbouring objects). 
Make it simple at first, use it only for objects with no progenitor to guess the position at the previous step and 
put a placeholder
