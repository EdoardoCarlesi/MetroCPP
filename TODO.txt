TO DO NEXT:


Fix the zoom-in mode and do some tests
The zoom-in mode should only read halos within the high-res region!!

Expand: 
Cosmology class (to compute the expansion factor of the universe) 
Gravity class (to compute the gravitational field at each point due to the neighbouring objects). 
Make it simple at first, use it only for objects with no progenitor to guess the position at the previous step and 
put a placeholder
