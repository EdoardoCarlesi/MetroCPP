TO DO NEXT:

- Make the output .tmp files with all the halo lists selectable from the .cfg file

- Change the output filename numbering format (from last snapshot to first one)

- Cosmology class (to compute the expansion factor of the universe) 

- Gravity class (to compute the gravitational field at each point due to the neighbouring objects). 
Make it simple at first, use it only for objects with no progenitor to guess the position at the previous step and 
put a placeholder
